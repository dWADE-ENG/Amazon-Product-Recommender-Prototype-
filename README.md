# Amazon-Product-Recommender-Prototype-
This project is a content-based product recommendation engine inspired by Amazon's "Customers who viewed this item also viewed" feature. It uses a dataset of product metadata and user interactions to suggest similar items based on product titles, brands, and categories using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
